Currying is a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c).

Currying doesnâ€™t call a function. It just transforms it.

  
```js
const curry =
  (f) =>
  	(a) =>
  		(b) =>
  			f(a, b);

const curry = (fn, arity = fn.length, ...args) => arity <= args.length ? fn(...args) : curry.bind(null, fn, arity, ...args);

```
