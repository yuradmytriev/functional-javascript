In other words, is any object we can map and apply a function generating another object instance of the same type and 
connections.

```js
[1, 2, 3].map(val => val * 2); //generates [2, 4, 6]
```

So, we can see that Array is a functor, because it has map function, generate and return another object with the same type.

```js
Object Type List -> Map -> New Object Type List
```
